## DID Panama
DID for Panamanian National ID using ICS23 Proof

### Idea for implementation

- Create a DID with an embedded ICS23 proof 
- Commitment proof is created from querying 3 sources of truth: social network account (name), QR information from Nequi (name) and national id QR (name and id)
- Value must be hiding using anoncreds and key in the following format  PA/8/713/2230, with no personal data expose
- Onchain anchoring can be requested through API or Smart Contract
- Additional proofs like Proof of Humanity can be added

### Use Cases

- Digital notaries
- Factoring NFT marketplaces
- Legal Tech
- Authentication
